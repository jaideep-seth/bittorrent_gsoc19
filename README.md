# Aim:

- My mentors and I aim to integrate within PyOpenWorm a P2P FileSharing framework with features like access control and data integrity checks to ensure the quality of content being shared. [PyOpenWorm currently installs](https://github.com/openworm/PyOpenWorm/blob/dev/INSTALL.md)

[Project statement and point of integration] (https://neurostars.org/t/gsoc-project-idea-16-1-peer-to-peer-file-and-metadata-sharing-for-openworm-data-management/3386)

- Our highest priority is to have no additional installation efforts required for this framework and that there is no change to the manner in which [PyOpenWorm currently installs](https://github.com/openworm/PyOpenWorm/blob/dev/INSTALL.md), while also not leaving the Command Line Interface(CLI).


## What has been done

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.
