# Aim:

- My mentors and I aim to integrate within PyOpenWorm a P2P FileSharing framework with features like access control and data integrity checks for the content being shared.  

- Our highest priority is to have no additional installation efforts required for this framework and that there is no change to the manner in which [PyOpenWorm currently installs](https://github.com/openworm/PyOpenWorm/blob/dev/INSTALL.md), while also not leaving the Command Line Interface(CLI).
